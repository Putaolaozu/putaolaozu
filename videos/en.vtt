00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.564
Today, some American politicians have become

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:03.598
more and more manic

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:06.198
in their anti-science and anti-rationality

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.725
They have repeatedly ignored the epidemic warnings

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:10.015
from various sources 

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:13.686
and have no fear to ban and suppress scientists.

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:15.538
Sharp comments emphasize that

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:16.976
in the United States today,

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.949
political calculation and extreme self-interest, 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.149
as well as the trampling and distortion of science and human nature,

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:24.251
have reached the pinnacle.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.263
The dazzling variety of evil acts and tricks of American politicians

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.425
have created an increasingly disorderly spider web

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.113
for themselves and the American people,

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.920
and the epidemic prevention and control of the United States

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:38.714
has fallen into this inextricable spiral hole.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.108
It can be imagined that

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:43.977
if these American politicians put their energy into fighting the epidemic

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.347
instead of such nonsense,

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:49.166
so many American lives would be saved!

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.884
In the face of the disappearance of 

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:55.139
more and more American people's lives,

00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:57.454
American politicians who are blinded by profits,

00:00:57.706 --> 00:00:59.169
hurry to get out of your own silk hole!
